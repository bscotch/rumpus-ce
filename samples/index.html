          Rumpus CE is the community edition of the Rumpus API, which powers
          Levelhead and the broader Butterscotch Shenanigans universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumpus is designed, created, and maintained by Adam Coster, the
          CTO and co-founder of Butterscotch Shenanigans. He spends most of
          his time making Rumpus instead of playing Levelhead, so his stats
          aren't very impressive. But hey, you're here to see Rumpus CE in
          action, not to see impressive Levelhead stats!
